A quick Battle Royale game where you spectate a number of bots built in unity.


I made this to get to grips with the Unity NavMesh system and using Raycasts for GameObject vision in order to simulate a bot walking around and following others. When a large number of bots are instantiated in a limited area (confined by a "red zone") the play becomes interesting to observe as certain behaviours are identified.

**Controls**


E - Enter Player POV 
S - Smite 
Esc/X - Exit Player POV
R - Restart
